# Telegram Google Calendar Automation (n8n)

An AI-powered automation workflow built in n8n that enables users to create, update, delete, and retrieve Google Calendar events directly from Telegram using natural language.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project connects Telegram, Gemini, and Google Calendar to build a conversational scheduling assistant.

Users can send messages like:

  - Schedule meeting at 9 am with Zahra on 8 December 2025  
  - Set a reminder tomorrow at 6pm to call mom  
  - Delete my meeting with Ravi next Monday  
  - What meetings do I have today?

The workflow processes the message, extracts structured event details using AI, performs the requested action in Google Calendar, and sends confirmation back via Telegram.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. User Input (Telegram)
- Accepts text messages
- Accepts voice messages (automatically transcribed)

### 2. AI Processing
The AI Agent:
- Detects user intent (create, update, delete, retrieve)
- Extracts:
  - Event title
  - Date and time
  - Duration
  - Attendees
  - Recurrence (if any)
- Converts relative dates (e.g., “tomorrow 9am”, “next Monday”)

### 3. Google Calendar Integration
Depending on the intent, the workflow:
- Creates a new event
- Updates an existing event
- Deletes an event
- Retrieves scheduled events

### 4. Confirmation
A structured confirmation message is sent back to the user via Telegram.
